# SetupCheckerBot

Reddit bot that is currently live at [u/SetupCheckerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/SetupCheckerBot) on [r/iOSthemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes).

It makes sure that users submitting device setups post top level comments that include things used to create their setups.

The bot is hosted on Heroku with the intention that running the bot is free of cost to me, so major decisions in how it was written is meant to accomodate that.
